Features to be added:
- A script to rip files from a course on vista (this is already implemented in the vista class using the download method on a VistaFolder download method).
- Course registration. This requires a method of checking whether a spot in the course is open or not and registering for it if it is.
- Library support. This could include a script to renew all books automatically.
- Better examples.
