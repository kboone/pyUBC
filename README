pyUBC - a library to access services of the University of British Columbia

ABOUT:

This library provides easy access to the various websites of the University of British Columbia (UBC). The CWL authentication present on most sites is built in to this system, and it is easy to add support for new sites. Webpages are scraped where no api is available for data. 

This library currently supports the following services:
- SSC
- Vista

---

REQUIREMENTS:

This library has been tested on Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 using python2.6 and python2.7. It should work on other systems but has not been tested.

---

USAGE:

A bunch of scripts showing how to use the library can be found in the scripts folder. These should be run from the scripts folder.

DISCLAIMER:

This library is in no way associated with the University of British Columbia (UBC) or its IT services. By using this library, you agree to abide with all of UBC's policies and Terms of Use. You agree to not hold the authors of this library responsible for any incidents caused by the use of this library.

SSC Terms of Use (from UBC's website, May 15th 2011).

I agree that I will not use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site. 

I agree that I will not use any robot, spider, other automatic device, or manual process to impose an "unreasonable or disproportionately large load" on UBC's infrastructure. An "unreasonable or disproportionately large load" is one that prevents other members of the University community from gaining fair and equitable access to Student Systems (by which we mean the Student Service Centre (SSC)). 

I understand that any activities undertaken in breach of this agreement will be considered non-academic misconduct and may result in disciplinary action as outlined in the Student Discipline section of the UBC Calendar
